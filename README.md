## FAQ

**How do I choose between cloud-based and desktop accounting software?**

Cloud-based solutions provide anywhere access, automatic updates, and simplified IT requirements—critical for hybrid teams and remote work. They connect bank feeds in real time and enable accountant collaboration without file sharing. Desktop software offers one-time purchase pricing but lacks mobility and requires manual backup management. For most modern businesses, cloud platforms deliver superior flexibility and security.

**Can small business management software handle both accounting and HR functions?**

Modern platforms increasingly combine financial and people management. Solutions like Pilim, Odoo, and Bitrix24 integrate accounting, HR, project management, and documentation in unified systems. This eliminates data silos and ensures payroll information flows directly to financial records. Evaluate whether your business needs deep accounting features or broader operational tools, then select platforms matching that priority.

**What's the fastest way to get started with new business management software?**

Begin by connecting bank accounts for automatic transaction importing, then set up basic chart of accounts and tax settings. Most platforms offer guided onboarding, video tutorials, and template libraries that accelerate deployment. Start with core functions like invoicing and expense tracking before adding advanced features. Many solutions provide free trials allowing hands-on testing before commitment.
